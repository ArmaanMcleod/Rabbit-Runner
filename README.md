### Usage:

You can download and play it from [here](https://opticgenius.itch.io/rabbit-runner). 

### Note: 
Only available on **Windows**. 

### Future
  Make it platform independent by hosting on WebGL. This currently doesn't work since the game does not render correctly on **MacOSX**. There is a shader bug that prohibits the cliffs from appearing.
